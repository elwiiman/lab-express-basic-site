        Fender Bass Guitars are one of the leading brands within the music
        industry and are commonly accredited with producing the first mainstream

        guitar collection, the Precision and Jazz basses are some of the most
        iconic. Precision basses such as the American Performer P Bass are
        accredited for their massive influence on music whilst Jazz basses, like
        the Player Jazz Bass, emit incredible high and rich tones for a fuller
